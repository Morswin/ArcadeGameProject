# TODO
## Important
- [ ] Add player controls and make player character visible
- [ ] Add enviroment display (walls and floor)
- [ ] Add random level generation (just the layout of a level)
- [ ] Add entity and wall collisions
## Optional
- [ ] Maybe it's a good idea to use glm or other already existing library to handle 2d vectors
