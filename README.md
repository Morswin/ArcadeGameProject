# About the repo
Project is now in **1.0.0v**, made purely to pass classes at my university course.

## The general vision
The details are in **GDD.md**. This hasn't been modified for some time, and it still contains some legacy ideas. It was used for brainstorming so far, but now it will need some more care and attention. This section will update, once the GDD is mostly ready.

## TODO
All of the requirements to call it ready for presentation at my university have been achieved. Now I will use the Issue tab to track and plan next changes to the project. It will require a lot more work and polishing, but the vision is here.

## Credits to resources are listed in
